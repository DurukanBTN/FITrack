# FITrack
## Track your route to a healthy lifestyle

**FITrack** will be an application where users can track their stats like:
- Their daily calorie intake
- Their workout routine
- The current and past weights, and number of repetitions they are using in exercises 
- Their body composition (Weight, height, body fat, muscle mass etc.)

The application will also have features like:
- Calculating the BMI of the user
- Graphical demonstrations of strength growth over time (not implemented yet as the current phase is console based)
- Recommending daily nutritional (protein, carbohydrate, calories, etc.) 
intakes depending on the body composition of the user

The target audience is the general public who want to track their fitness or lifestyle goals and achievements.
This project is of interest to me because I know from experience that keeping track of your progress especially in 
the context of fitness, is a huge source of motivation and confidence. It also allows you to progressively overload.
Which means increasing the weights of exercises overtime according to the weights you are using currently and the ones
that you were using in the past.
